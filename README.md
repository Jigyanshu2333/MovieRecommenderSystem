This is a project based on the basic concepts of machine learning concepts.

It uses cosine similarity to find the movies that are very similar to the user's preferences.

The datasets were pretty big so can't add to the repoistory but you can download them from kaggles datasets.

You can download datasets from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata" or you can search "tmdb 5000 movie datasets" on google.
